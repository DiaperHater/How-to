Switch to particular commit:
    git log (to list commits)
    git checkout HASH_OF_PARTICULAR_COMMIT
    git checkout master (return to HEAD)
    
Undo all working dir changes including new files:
    git reset --hard # removes staged and working directory changes

    ## !! be very careful with these !!
    ## you may end up deleting what you don't want to
    ## read comments and manual.
    git clean -f -d # remove untracked
    git clean -f -x -d # CAUTION: as above but removes ignored files like config.
    git clean -fxd :/ # CAUTION: as above, but cleans untracked and ignored files through the entire repo (without :/, the operation affects only the current directory)

    To see what will be deleted before-hand, without actually deleting it, use the -n flag (this is basically a test-run). When you are ready to actually delete, then remove the -n flag:

    git clean -nfd
